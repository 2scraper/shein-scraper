"""output_writer.py — the row model, JSON/CSV writer, dedupe, exit codes,
and run metadata. Carries (almost) no site knowledge: everything here is
part of the family's shared output CONTRACT — diverging from it needs a
written reason, not a per-site tweak. Ported near-verbatim from
lidl-scraper's output_writer.py (CLAUDE.md §7: porting starts by copying
the family-shared modules from the newest sibling and diffing what
changed on purpose) — in turn ported from skyscanner-scraper's, in turn
from stockx-scraper's original (commit 00b5570). The exit codes,
STATUS_BY_EXIT map, and finish_run() outcome-precedence logic are
IDENTICAL to every prior family member on purpose, including the fix
from a 2026-09-15 audit that found `blocked`/`remote_api_error` were
being silently ignored whenever products were present or --allow-empty
was passed. Only the `Product` dataclass's site-specific tail (below the
family-common fields) differs per repo.

    2scraper repo — stockx-scraper, skyscanner-scraper, lidl-scraper,
    perplexity-scraper, and this one); shein.com-specific (fashion listing)
    fields at the end.

    `sku` is `goods_id` — the site's own numeric product identifier,
    confirmed real and stable per product across its color/size variants
    (see `shein_parser.py`'s module docstring for the live capture this is
    based on) — falling back to a deterministic fingerprint of
    `product_url` (`make_sku()`) only when it can't be extracted, never a
    random or run-scoped id, so `diff_runs.py` still sees the same `sku`
    for the same item across two different runs. Note this is a
    DIFFERENT id scheme than `goods_sn` (the search-card's own "SKU"
    string, e.g. `sz260112133381631268128`) or a product-detail page's
    per-variant `sku` (e.g. `I93s3po0gvt5`, one per size) — `goods_id` was
    chosen because it is the one identifier confirmed stable across both a
    search-result card and that same product's own detail-page URL.

    `brand` is confirmed real (`premiumFlagNew.brandName`) — SHEIN is a
    marketplace of many in-house and third-party labels, not a single
    private-label retailer, so unlike lidl-scraper this is genuinely
    variable per row, not usually the storefront's own name.
    `category` is the site's own assigned category for the item
    (`cate_name`, e.g. "Women Mini Dresses"), confirmed real.

    `price` / `currency` / `price_source` are the columns `diff_runs.py`
    and every cross-site tool key off, same as every other family member.
    `price` is `salePrice.amount` (the actual charged price — SHEIN shows
    both a `retailPrice` "was" price and a `salePrice` "now" price on
    nearly every card) converted to float; `original_price`/`discount_pct`
    below carry the "was" side. `price_source` is `"embedded_json"` when
    the price came from the page's own `window.gbRawData` state (confirmed
    real — see module docstring) and `"dom"` when read off the rendered
    card directly as a fallback.

    A SHEIN card carries its own rating/review count and marketplace-style
    seller/fulfilment flags (`store_code`, `quickship`) that no other
    family member's schema has a slot for — kept here rather than folded
    into an existing field, same principle as lidl-scraper's own
    grocery-specific tail.
